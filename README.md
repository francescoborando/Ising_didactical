# 2D Ising Model Simulation

Welcome to the Ising_didactical - 2D Ising Model Simulation repository! This project explores the dynamic behavior of magnetic spins in a 2D lattice, offering insights into phase transitions and emergent patterns within the Ising model - come, unravel the magic rabbithole of phase behaviors through simulations üê∞üï≥Ô∏è !

## Overview

The Ising model is a classical statistical mechanics model used to study magnetic properties in materials - more generally, it serves as a foundational framework for exploring collective behaviors resulting in phase transitions in diverse complex system. In this repo, we focus on the 2D variant, where spins interact with their neighbors, showcasing intriguing phase behavior.

## Features

- **Simulation Code:** Python code for simulating the 2D Ising Model.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing the dynamic evolution of spins and analyzing phase transitions.
- **Phase Behavior Analysis:** Insights and analysis of the observed phase behavior.


## Acknowledgments

This is a didactical project which I coded to learn more about the Ising model. Anyone with a basic training in statistical and computational physics can follow along and (hopefully) learn something new. 
Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
