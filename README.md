# 2D Ising Model Simulation

Welcome to the Ising_didactical - 2D Ising Model Simulation repository! 

This project explores the dynamic behavior of magnetic spins in a 2D lattice, offering insights into phase transitions and emergent patterns within the Ising model.

## Overview

The Ising model is a classical statistical mechanics model used to study magnetic properties in materials - more generally, it serves as a foundational framework for exploring collective behaviors resulting in phase transitions in diverse complex system. In this repo, we focus on the 2D variant, where spins interact with their neighbors, showcasing intriguing phase behavior.

We implement a basic version of the Metropolis Algorithm and subsequently explore the optimized code presented by J.P. Sethna in the insightful book 'Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity'. 
Leveraging these coding tools, we investigate the system's phase behavior by analyzing the magnetization order parameter and its susceptibility. 
Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to measure cluster sizes on the grid, allowing for the examination of power law distributions.


## Acknowledgments

This is a didactical project which I coded to learn more about the Ising model. Anyone with a basic training in statistical and computational physics can follow along and (hopefully) learn something new. 
Many thanks to Prof. Francesco Font-Clos for his guidance and help in this project.
